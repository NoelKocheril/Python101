## VS Code Installation <a id="VSCode"  name="VSCode"></a>

---

We will first start off by setting up an environment to code within using VS Code. VS Code is a multi purpose IDE and text editor which can be used to run various programming languages and deal with multiple tools and be extended with various extensions to improve the consistency and speed at which you are able to program.

VS Code: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Install the Appropraite version for your operating system (most likely Windows X64).

### Live Share <a id="LiveShare" name="LiveShare"></a>

We will be adding a couple extensions to VS Code to help improve the way we can program as well as making it easier for me to show you what I am doing without the video compression that comes with Discord or other conferencing tools.

The first extensions will be Live Share. This is an extension which we can use to create a session where we can share the text editor so that you can follow along easier as well allowing me to let you take control.

Live Share can be installed using the following link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare

### Python Extension <a id="PythonEXT" name="PythonEXT"></a>

The following python extension adds a few extra features that will help you create maintainable and clean code. It comes with features such as Auto-Completion, Linting, Code Formatting, Debugging, Testing, and hot swapping of Environments.

The python extensions can be installed using the following link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python

<br>

### Tabnine <a id="Tabnine" name="Tabnine"></a>

The Tabnine extension is a tool that adds to the autocomplete features of VS Code and the Python Extension. This extension is built on top of various other developer's codebases and tries to provide more accurate suggestions especially when do various steps such as creating loops and initializing variables.

The python extensions can be installed using the following link: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TabNine.tabnine-vscode

## Python Installation <a id="Python" name="Python"></a>

---

We will be using Python for this course. Python is a powerful, dynamically typed language that works across multiple platforms that can be extended with the use of various external libraries.

Direct Python Installation: [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) \
Windows Store: [Link](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P7QFQMJRFP7)

Note: If you are installing Python using the Direct Installation, you must have Python added to your PATH. This will allow you to be able to call python from anywhere on your system.

## Why Python? <a id="WhyPython" name="WhyPython"></a>

---

We will teaching this class as an introduction to Python as it is an user friendly langauge that tends to be easy to pick up and understand, but at the same time provides flexibility to create power applications and scripts.

Why should you learn Python:

- Python is extremely versatile, with multiple uses
  - Data Science
  - Machine Learning
  - Automation scripts
  - Web Scraping
- Python is one of the most popular programming languages used in industry
  - TOIBE Index: [Link](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)

Why you should not learn Python:

- You want to write super speed and resource critical applications. Python is a very high level language that is not equipped to handle minute memory management. Other languages like C, C++, and Rust are much better equipped to handle this.
- You are more prone to potential run time errors. This is due to python being a dynamically typed language, which means that we can not enforce data to be sent in a specific manner and will results in issues that can only be discovered when the programming is running. This requires the developer to create additional testing and account for more potential issues than other languages.
- Python has low usability for creating UI and Game Elements.
