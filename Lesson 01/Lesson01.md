We will first start off by setting up an environment to code within using VS Code. VS Code is a multi purpose IDE and text editor which can be used to run various programming languages and deal with multiple tools and be extended with various extensions to improve the consistency and speed at which you are able to program.

We will be using Python for this course. Python is a powerful, dynamically typed language that works across multiple platforms that can be extended with the use of various external libraries.

We will teaching this class as an introduction to Python as it is an user friendly langauge that tends to be easy to pick up and understand, but at the same time provides flexibility to create power applications and scripts.

Why should you learn Python:

- Python is extremely versatile, with multiple uses
  - Data Science
  - Machine Learning
  - Automation scripts
  - Web Scraping
- Python is one of the most popular programming languages used in industry

Why you should not learn Python:

- You want to write super speed and resource critical applications. Python is a very high level language that is not equipped to handle minute memory management. Other languages like C, C++, and Rust are much better equipped to handle this.
- You are more prone to potential run time errors. This is due to python being a dynamically typed language, which means that we can not enforce data to be sent in a specific manner and will results in issues that can only be discovered when the programming is running. This requires the developer to create additional testing and account for more potential issues than other languages.
- Python has low
