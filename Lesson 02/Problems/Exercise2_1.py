# Exercise 2.1: Creating variables and print them out
#
# In this exercise, I would like you to create three variables:
#
# 1. Your Name
# 2. Your Age
# 3. A list of places you like
#
# and print them out with a blurb before each. For example, "My Name is: {Name}".
#
# Note: You can convert an integer or a list to a string by using the str() function.
